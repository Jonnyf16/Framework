1. Execute program
1. We change code in [Program.cs](Program.cs)
1. Give each vertex a different color
1. Execute and compare
	+ Note that OpenGL is a state machine. Color stays until other color is selected.
1. Make the whole quad move to the right over time
1. Make the whole quad move to some direction over time
1. Make the quad change directions if it leaves the window
1. Move the render code for the quad into a function `void DrawBox(Box2D box)`
1. Render a number of boxes that move into different directions
	+ These are our enemies
1. We add one box that will be our player
	1. This box moves to the left if `Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Key.Left)` is true
	1. This box moves to the right if `Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Key.Right)` is true
1. In the next example we make the boxes react to each other
