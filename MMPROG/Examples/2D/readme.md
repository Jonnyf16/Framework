1. [HelloWorld.glsl](HelloWorld.glsl)
	1. Colors (line i)
		1. Invert the colors
		1. Make them brighter, darker
	1. Functions (line ii and iii) [detailed description](https://thebookofshaders.com/07/)
		1. Compare the result of lines ii and iii
		1. How can you rotate the result by 90°?
		1. Combine results from multiple step functions like in line iv
		1. Use the step function to draw a quad
		1. USe smoothstep to draw soft edged quads
		1. Can you do something that resembles a Piet Mondrian painting? ![Mondrian painting](mondrian.jpg "Mondrian painting")
1. [ShapingFunctions.glsl](ShapingFunctions.glsl)
	1. Uncomment the different functions
	1. How to draw the green line? Create such a function plotter!
	1. How can we map coordinates to a bigger range than [0..1]²?
	1. How are verticel/horizontal lines that keep their thickness realized?
	1. Choose a function with very steep parts. What happens?
	1. How can we control the thickness of general functions?
	1. Create your own fucntion using sin, smoothstep, mod, ...
1. [CircleDistanceField.glsl](CircleDistanceField.glsl)
	1. We look at code together
	1. Uncomment from top to bottom
