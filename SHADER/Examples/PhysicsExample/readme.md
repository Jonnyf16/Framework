Tip: Try the forces in these exercises first in isolation (only wind, only downward gravity) before combining them.

Tip 2: On [Nature of code](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-2-forces/#chapter02_example6) you will find working implementations if you have trouble doing it on your own (along with very nice explanations).

1. Implement wind
1. Implement downward gravity (everything falls down onto a plane)
1. Implement gravitational attraction (use your own gravitational constant, because real gravity is really small e.x.: 0.1)
