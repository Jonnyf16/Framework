Tip: Try the forces in these exercises first in isolation (only wind, only downward gravity) before combining them.

Tip 2: On [Nature of code](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-2-forces/#chapter02_example6) you will find working implementations if you have trouble doing it on your own (along with very nice explanations).

1. Implement wind
1. Implement downward gravity (every head falls down onto the plane). Very similar to wind.
    - Plane geometry is prepared in the code
1. Implement gravitational attraction (use your own gravitational constant, because real gravity is really small e.x.: 0.1)
1. Implement another force like resistance 
   - Consider for example a water basin, which offers resistance in a certain space
