##Programming
+ [Data-oriented design](http://www.dataorienteddesign.com/dodmain/dodmain.html) In computing, data-oriented design (not to be confused with data-driven design) is a program optimization approach motivated by cache coherency, used in video game development. The approach is to focus on the data layout, separating and sorting fields according to when they are needed, and to think about transformations of data.
